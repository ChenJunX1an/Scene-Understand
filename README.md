# Scene Understand

This repo benefits from [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/), [Chat-Scene](https://github.com/ZzZZCHS/Chat-Scene). Thanks for their wonderful works.


## ðŸ”¨ Preparation

- Prepare the environment:
  
  ```shell
  conda create -n chat-scene python=3.9.17
  conda activate chat-scene
  conda install pytorch==2.2.1 torchvision==0.17.1 torchaudio==2.2.1 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- Download LLM backbone:
  -  We use Vicuna-7B v1.5 in our experiments, which can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5).

  - Change the `llama_model_path` in [run.sh](./scripts/run.sh) to the path of `vicuna-7b-v1.5`.
  

- Annotations and extracted features:
  
  Please follow the instructions in [preprocess](preprocess/).


## ðŸ¤– Training and Inference

- Training
  - Modify [run.sh](scripts/run.sh):
    ```python
    train_tag="scanrefer#scan2cap#scanqa#sqa3d#multi3dref#nr3d_caption#obj_align"
    val_tag="scanrefer#scan2cap#scanqa#sqa3d#multi3dref"
    evaluate=False
    ```

    <details>
    <summary> Explanation of "train_tag" and "val_tag" </summary>

    - Use `#` to seperate different datasets

    - Datasets:
      - `scanrefer`: [ScanRefer](https://github.com/daveredrum/ScanRefer) Dataset
      - `scan2cap`: [Scan2Cap](https://github.com/daveredrum/Scan2Cap) Dataset
      - `scanqa`: [ScanQA](https://github.com/ATR-DBI/ScanQA) Dataset
      - `sqa3d`: [SQA3D](https://github.com/SilongYong/SQA3D) Dataset
      - `multi3dref`: [Multi3dRefer](https://github.com/3dlg-hcvc/M3DRef-CLIP) Dataset
      - `nr3d_caption`: A captioning dataset originated from [Nr3D](https://github.com/referit3d/referit3d).
      - `obj_align`: A dataset originated from ScanRefer to align the object identifiers with object tokens.

    </details>
  - Run: `bash scripts/run.sh`


- Inference
  
  - Modify [run.sh](scripts/run.sh): (We provide the pretrained checkpoint in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ziz7Be9l6MEbn3Qmlyr9gv42C0iJQgAn/view?usp=sharing))
  
    ```python
    val_tag="scanrefer#scan2cap#scanqa#sqa3d#multi3dref"
    evaluate=True
    pretrained_path="/path/to/pretrained_model.pth"
    ```
  
  - Run: `bash scripts/run.sh`
